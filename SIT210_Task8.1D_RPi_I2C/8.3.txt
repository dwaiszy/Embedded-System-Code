Firstly, with the device connected and the Pi powered up the “i2cdetect” 
command should show the device with address 0x23.

As shown on the circuit board, we connect the sensor's GND to one of the 
GND pins on Raspberry Pi, both of the SDA and SCL to correctsponding pins on Pi, and
VCC to 3.3 Volts.


    The import statements import Python libraries used in the rest of the code including smbus which handles the I2C interface.
    The “smbus.SMBus(1)” function setups the I2C interface.
    The “read_i2c_block_data” function is used to read 2 bytes of data from the device using the ONE_TIME_HIGH_RES_MODE variable.
    The convertToNumber function is then used to convert those 2 bytes of data into a number. The 1.2 value in the calculation is defined in 
the BH1750 Ambient Light Sensor IC datasheet datasheet.

Finally, as shown in the main function, I set up specific threshold for the light level, so the console could print out 5 categories correspond to
the current's environment lighting
